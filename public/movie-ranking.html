<h1>The Best Movies According To Ven</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 movies off all-time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
 <p>Is one of the first series that i watched as a kid
     and i never get tired of rewatching it, it gives this
      feeling of nostalgia that brings me back to my childhood.
       Very well done as for my opinion, the story is very intriguing
        and nhas this suspense feeling, the characters are also 
        really well created, my favorite is probably Profesor Snape.</p>

<h3>Pirates Of The Caraiben</h3>
<p>Lets start it for the first reason why i think is one 
    of the bests and is because Johnny Depp , he's my 
    favorite actor of all time and this series is one of 
    his masterpieces.The storie is very aventuring,funny 
    and out of the ordinary especually because of him since
    he makes everything funny. It's about the aventures of
     jack sparrow and his fellow pirates around the caribean
     with each movie being even more einteresting than the
      last one. </p>
<h3>The Conjuring</h3>
<p>This one is a horror one but  since am a really big 
    fan of scary movies i coild't leave them out of this.
    This one talk about parandormal activities happening 
    to a family that just moved in to a new hause, having 
    really scary stuff happening to them,scary presences and 
    animals being killed. For that reason they decided to call
    some exorcists to help them deal with that , and the most 
    interesting thing is that is based on a true story.</p>
